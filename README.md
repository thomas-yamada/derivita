5.3 Slide 6/7 Series definition fill in and dropdown
    An infinite series (or simply series) is an infinite summation, denoted by
    \sum_{i=1}^\infty a_i = __
    where ai is a [sequence] indexed by __.

If we only add up n of the terms, we get a [partial sum]:
__ = \sum{i=1}^n ai = __.


5.3 Slide 14 Properties of Sums
    Let {a_k} and {b_k} be sequences and let c be a real number. Then:
    (1) … let’s talk about this one.

Hey Thomas, I'm assigning you these 3 problems:

6.9 Example 4
    Same as this example but randomize angle shift as a multiple of π/3. Ask for general solutions and solutions in [0,2π). Solution should show graph.


6.9 Example 5
    Notes: use cos(theta). randomize angle output value. Ask for general solutions and solutions in [0,2π). Solution should show graph.

6.9 Example 5
    Same as above but with cos(theta).
You may not be able to use the exact same code as I wrote for the current 6.9 problems, but it should be easy to modify for these questions.  In particular for the Example 5 problems, I think you only need to modify the display equation and the solution steps.

6.2 Angular and linear velocity
    Find the angular and linear velocity of an object moving in circular motion given the radius and angle.
    (a) r := random(2,10), theta := random(radian measure less than 2π)
    (b) r := random_exclude(2,10,a), random(degree measure less than 360)
    (c) r := random(2,10), theta := random(negative radian measure less than 2π)



6.2 Angular and linear velocity
    An object is traveling around a circle with a radius r := random(2,10) feet/meters (randomize). The object travels s := random(5,20) feet/meters in t := random(10,60) seconds. What is the angular and linear velocity?



6.2 Angular and linear velocity question about the large hadron collider. Give circumference: 26.7 km. Give particle revs per second: 11,245 revs/sec. 
    (a) angular velocity
    (b) linear velocity
    (c) Given the speed of light is about 299,792,458 m/sec, what percentage of the speed of light is the linear velocity? Give answer to [7] decimal places (Should be 99.9999991%).

**1.4.3.5** 4.3 Example 4
    Consider the equation log_a(bx+c) = d.
    (a) State the domain of the variable in interval and set-builder notation.
    (b) Solve the equation for x.
    Notes: Randomize input variable random_item(x,t,s). Randomize base: random(2,5). Randomize constants, but be mindful of the size of things. See Q2.1.25 for set builder notation example. In the feedback, show a graph of the lefthand and righthand side of the equation, showing the solution. For the solutions, mimic the solution on slide 29. Important note: students only know the inversion formula at this point, not how to take logs of both sides.

**1.4.3.8** 4.3 Example 5
    Consider the equation log_x(a)=b.
    (a) State the domain of the variable in interval and set-builder notation.
    (b) Solve the equation for x.
    Notes: Randomize input variable random_item(x,t). Randomize constants, but be mindful of the size of things. See Q2.1.25 for set builder notation example, this one will be bit tricky. For the solutions, mimic the solution on slide 30. Important note: students only know the inversion formula at this point, not how to take logs of both sides.

**1.4.3.9** 4.3 Example 6
    Consider the equation e^{ax}=b.
    (a) State the domain of the variable in interval and set-builder notation.
    (b) Solve the equation for x.
    Notes: Randomize input variable random_item(x,t,s). Randomize constants, but be mindful of the size of things. See Q2.1.25 for set builder notation example, this one will have an xinR/tinR/sinR option. For the solutions, mimic the solution on slide 31. Important note: students only know the inversion formula at this point, not the laws of logs.

    (b) T/F log_a(m-n) = log_am - log_an

    (a) Ask student to enter the factored form a(x-r1)(x-r2)

    Notes: roots should be +/- integers. Roots should be given as x-values, not points. Coordinates of third point should be +/- integers. Solution should have a graph of the parabola.
