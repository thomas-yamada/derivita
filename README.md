3.4 Example 1
    Give two zeros and a third point. 
    (a) Ask student to enter the factored form a(x-r1)(x-r2)
    (b) Find a and give the complete factored form.
    Notes: roots should be +/- integers. Roots should be given as x-values, not points. Coordinates of third point should be +/- integers. Solution should have a graph of the parabola.

3.4 Example 1
    -Duplicate question above but make numbers decimals with 1 decimal place.

3.4 Example 2
    -Duplicate question above but make the two roots square roots of non-perfect squares.

3.5 Example 6
    -Copy this example. 
    Notes: See 3.2.11 feedback to see how I made the sign diagram
