3.4 Example 1
    Give two zeros and a third point. 
    (a) Ask student to enter the factored form a(x-r1)(x-r2)
    (b) Find a and give the complete factored form.
    Notes: roots should be +/- integers. Roots should be given as x-values, not points. Coordinates of third point should be +/- integers. Solution should have a graph of the parabola.

3.4 Example 1
    -Duplicate question above but make numbers decimals with 1 decimal place.

3.4 Example 2
    -Duplicate question above but make the two roots square roots of non-perfect squares.

3.5 Example 6
    -Copy this example. 
    Notes: See 3.2.11 feedback to see how I made the sign diagram

3.7.8 Slide 6 Euclid’s’ Division Lemma GAP FILL
    -Gaps:
        -b(x)≠0
        -r=0 or deg(r)<deg(b)
        -all bolded words

3.7.9 Slide 7 An Important Interpretation GAP FILL
    Notes: Give boxed equations.
    -Gaps:
        -difference function
        -d(x) = a(x)/b(x) - q(x)
        -“d(x) explicitly gives the difference between the rational function  and it’s _ the polynomial .

3.7.10 Slide 34 FTA
    Notes: dropdown and inline-fill in the blank
    Every __ polynomial of degree [n≥1,n≥2,n≥3] has at least one complex zero.

3.7.11 Slide 35 corollary
    Every __ polynomial can be uniquely factored into a product of _ factors.
